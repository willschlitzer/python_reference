By default, git saves data to a master branch for the project
To work on segments of a project, or an experimental change, alternate branches can be created

To see the current project's branches:
    git branches
The current branch will have an asterisk next to it

To display a graphical history of the branches and their commits:
    git log --graph --oneline --decorate --all
