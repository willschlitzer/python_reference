Before a git repository can be used, it much be initialized
In command line, switch to the folder of the project

Initialize the git repository:
    git init

A .gitignore should be created to have certain files avoided from the git repository
Examples include: personal API keys, personal data, etc.
In a Unix-like environment:
    touch .gitignore
The .gitignore can be edited as a regular text file (it may be a hidden file)
