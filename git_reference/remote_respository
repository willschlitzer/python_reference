A remote repository (such as Github) may be used, either as a means to make the project publicly available or collaborative

To add a git repository:
    Navigate to the desired folder for the project
    The git clone will create a top-level folder
    git clone <git repository address/url>

To update a local repository from a remote respository:
    git pull

To push changes to a remote repository:
    git push origin master
    User account services such as GitHub will request a username/password
