"""And explanation of lists in Python"""

# A list is an ordered set of data

# Lists are defined with the square brackets: []
# Every entry in a list is separated by a comma

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Every entry in a list is indexed, beginning at 0
# The desired index of a list is indicated after the list name with square brackets
print(my_list[3])

# Data types in lists do not have to be uniform
