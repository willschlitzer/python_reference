"""An explanation of functions"""

# A function is defined with the 'def' preamble and '()' after
def print_hello():
    print("Hello")


# functions are then called with the name and '()'
print_hello()

# Functions can include variables/data for us
def print_text(text):
    print(text)


print_text("Hi")
